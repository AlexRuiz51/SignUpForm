# SignUpForm
Here you can see my project it has all the required EditText Attributes; Name, Email, Password and PasswordConfirmation.
Here is what it looks like:

Aside from the button being an onclick that checks the text boxes when tapped each of the text boxes are set to a variable so that they
can be checked for the requirements, as it stands now there are only two: That no field is empty & that password matches passwordConfirmation.
When the program detects a something amiss such as a blank or non-matching passwords it put out an error message and tell the user what went wrong as well as how to correct it.
In addition to this each error displays a toast message as well, a toast message of success is also sent went the entered data is accepted.
